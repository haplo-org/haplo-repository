# Haplo Academic Repository

Plugins to the [Haplo Platform](https://haplo.org) which implement the [Academic Repository](https://www.haplo.com/repository) module of [Haplo Research Manager](https://www.haplo.com/research-manager).

### Quickstart

The quickest way to get started is to use the [Docker quickstart](https://haplo.org/documentation/run/docker) guide with `APPPLUGIN="hresrepodemo_application"` set in the installation configuration data.

This will create a system running on the Haplo Platform with the Repository and Research Manager plugins installed for an example repository application.

Logging in, use the "Generate test data" option on the right hand side to populate the system with randomly generated data (which will take a couple of minutes). This will create users within the system, assign them to roles, and fill the system with random data for the key data types relevant to an institutional repository. 

The homepage of the application contains instructions for the processes and features included, as well as suggested users from different roles to impersonate.

An example public interface to the repository is also provided, linked from the homepage, as an illustration of the ways Haplo repositories can publish information held and managed internally to the external world.

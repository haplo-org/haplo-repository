# Haplo Academic Repository

Plugins to the [Haplo Platform](https://haplo.org) which implement the open source [Haplo Repository](https://www.haplo.com/repository).

### Quickstart

The quickest way to get started is to use the [Docker quickstart](https://docs.haplo.org/platform/run/docker) guide with `APPPLUGIN="hresrepodemo_application"` set in the installation configuration data. This will create a system running on the Haplo Platform with the Haplo Repository plugins installed for an example repository application.

If you can't use Docker or would like to develop enhancements to Haplo Repository, you can [run the platform in other modes](https://docs.haplo.org/platform).

After logging in, use the "Generate test data" option on the right hand side to populate the system with randomly generated data (which will take a couple of minutes). This will create users within the system, assign them to roles, and fill the system with random data for the key data types relevant to an institutional repository. 

The homepage of the application contains instructions for the processes and features included, as well as suggested users from different roles to impersonate.

The standard public interface to the repository is included, linked from the homepage, showing the standard interface to publish a Haplo Repository on the web. This can be configured with text, images and branding, or replaced entirely with a custom publication.

<h3> "Collecting items in the tray" </h3>

<p> "When adding a new portfolio record, the items in " <a href="/do/tray"> "your tray" </a> " will be added as members of the portfolio. You may find it easier to collect research items there first." </p>

<p> "Add items to the tray using the tray icon in the top right corner of research item records." </p>

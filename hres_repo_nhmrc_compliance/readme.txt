title: NHMRC compliance checker
--

The NHMRC is an Australian open access policy which applies to research outputs (specfically literature/data/patents) funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council.

The policy has 3 distinct sections that apply to different types of output.

h2. Research literature

This policy is applicable to publications which, from the NHMRC OA Policy Document, appears to encompass mostly peer-reviewed journal articles/conference items, however the policy also states:

bq. "NHMRC also encourages authors of scholarly books, scholarly book chapters, edited research books, including prestigious reference works, and producers of other forms of research outputs to make them openly accessible where possible."

These requirements are checked for compliance by checking that the output was deposited at most 3 months after it's earliest publication date, and a file was added to the output at most 12 months after it's earlist publication date, if this output wasn't openly accessible within 12 months it's down to the Author(s)/Repository Editors to check a confirm box in a form to verify that the NHMRC grants management system has been updated to reflect this.

h3. Policy Requirements

bq. "NHMRC requires that any peer-reviewed publication arising from NHMRC supported research must be made openly accessible in an institutional repository or other acceptable location (e.g. publisher website, subject repositories) within a 12-month period from the date of publication. This policy applies to all publications from 1 July 2012 except for peer-reviewed conference papers where it applies from 15 January 2018."

bq. "The metadata for the peer-reviewed publication must be made openly accessible via an institutional repository as soon as possible but no later than 3 months from the date of publication. The publication metadata requirement applies regardless of whether the publication is openly accessible upon publication, will be made openly accessible in the future, or will never be made openly accessible."

bq. "If authors are unable to make their publications open access within 12 months of the date of publication for any reason, this must be clearly indicated in the publication record listed in the NHMRC grants management system."


h2. Research data

These requirements are all subjective and due to this they all require that the Author(s)/Repository Editors check a confirm box in a form to verify each of these requirements are met.

h3. Policy Requirements

bq. "When sharing data, researchers should ensure that appropriate metadata accompany the datasets."

bq. "When sharing research data, researchers must also consider the appropriate level of access that they would like to provide to users."

bq. "NHMRC requires that all research metadata arising from NHMRC funded research, including for datasets created prior to the due date for the Final Report that have been lodged in a repository, must be listed in the Final Report for each Project."

bq. "Researchers who use secondary data must acknowledge the original research team and provide a citation to the data source."

h2. Patents

These requirements are all subjective/to do with actions taken in external systems and due to this they all require that the Author(s)/Repository Editors check a confirm box in a form to verify each of these requirements are met.

h3. Policy Requirements

bq. "Details of patent applications (including the invention title) are published in the Australian Official Journal Of Patents 18 months after the application's earliest priority date"

bq. "Australian publicly funded NHMRC Administering Institutions to be listed as 'Research Organisations' with Source IP, and to list Australian filed patent publications generated as a result of NHMRC funding on Source IP"

bq. "Patents listed on Source IP which are associated with NHMRC funding, must reference the relevant NHMRC Grant ID in the description on Source IP"
